                    What is Sass? That's the question we
                    here to answer. If you're new to web design, you've probably heard the term
                    floating around, but you might not be quite up to speed with exactly what Sass
                    is, what is does, and whether or not you should be using it. In short, Sass is
                    a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules
                    and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The aim
                    is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient. Let's explore in more
                    detail.

            What is a CSS preprocessor?
        </h1>

        <p>

            A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language
            that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then
            compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most popular preprocessor around right
            now, but other well-known examples include Less and Stylus.

        </p>

        <p>

            Before we go any further, a quick public
            service announcement is in order: most web designers would say that if you're
            new to CSS, you're better off avoiding Sass (or any preprocessors, extensions
            or frameworks) while you're still learning. While it's true they offer many
            advantages in speed and efficiency, it's important that you really get to grips
            with the basics of CSS. Make sure you learn the core concepts before you start
            exploring shortcuts and confusing things.

                Sass is arguably the most useful of all
                CSS extensions

        <p>

            Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically
            awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things
            like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep
            things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.

        </p>



        <p>

            Sass is compatible with all versions of
            CSS. The only requirement for using it is that you must have Ruby installed.
            Users are also asked to follow the Sass Community Guidelines.

        <p>How to use Sass</p>



        <p>

            In the following section, we'll outline
            some basic tips for using Sass, using examples from the official Sass website.
            Take a look at the Sass Documentation for additional references and examples.

        <h1>
            Syntax
        </h1>



        <p><b>Sass includes two syntax options:</b></p>



        <ul>
            <li>
                SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the
                .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax
            </li>

            <li>
                Indented (simply called
                'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than brackets; it is
                not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write
            </li>
        </ul>
                        
        <p>
            <i>

                Note that files can be converted from
                one syntax to the other using the sass-convert command.

            </i>
        </p>



        <h1>
            Variables
        </h1>



        <p>

            Just like other programming languages, Sass
            allows the use of variables that can store information you can use throughout
            your style sheet. For example, you can store a colour value in a variable at
            the top of the file, and then use this variable when setting the colour of your
            elements. This enables you to quickly change your colours without having to
            modify each line separately.

        </p>



        <p><b>For example:</b></p>



        <p>
            <i>

                $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p><i>$primary-color: #333;</i></p>



        <p><i>body {</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>

                font:
                100% $font-stack;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>

                color:
                $primary-color;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p><i>}</i></p>



        <p><i>The following CSS will be produced:</i></p>



        <p><i>body {</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>

                font:
                100% Helvetica, sans-serif;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>

                color:
                #333;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p><i>}</i></p>



        <h1>
            Nesting
        </h1>



        <p>

            Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it
            provides an excellent method for reducing the amount of code you need to write,
            it can also lead to over-qualified CSS if not executed carefully. The idea is
            to nest your CSS selectors in such a way as to mimic your HTML hierarchy.

        </p>



        <p>

            The following shows a basic navigation
            style that uses nesting:

        </p>



        <p><i>nav {</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>

                ul
                {

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>


                margin: 0;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>


                padding: 0;

            </i>

        <h1>
            Partials
        </h1>



        <p>

            Partials are smaller Sass files that can be
            imported (see next section) into other Sass files. Think of partials as code
            snippets. With these code snippets, your CSS can now be modular and easier to
            maintain. A partial is designated as such by naming it with a leading
            underscore: _partial.scss.

        </p>

        <p>Import</p>



        <p>

            Used with Partials (see previous section),
            the @import directive allows you to import your partial files into the current
            file, to build one single CSS file. Be mindful of how many imports you're using
            as an HTTP request will be generated for each one.

        <h1>
            Mixins
        </h1>



        <p>
            <b>

                One of the advantages of using
                preprocessors is their ability to take complex, long-winded code and simplify
                it. This is where mixins come in handy!

            </b>
        </p>



        <p>

            For example, if you need to include the
            vendor prefixes, you can use a mixin instead. Take a look at this example for
            border-radius:

        </p>



        <p><i>@mixin border-radius($radius) {</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>

                -webkit-border-radius:
                $radius;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>


                -moz-border-radius: $radius;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>


                -ms-border-radius: $radius;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>


                border-radius: $radius;

            </i>
        </p>

        <p><i>}</i></p>



        <p><i>.box { @include border-radius(10px); }</i></p>



        <p>

            Notice the @mixin directive at the top. It
            has been given the name border-radius and uses the variable $radius as its
            parameter. This variable is used to set the radius value for each element.

        </p>



        <p>

            Later, the @include directive is called,
            along with the mixin name (border-radius) and a parameter (10px). Thus .box {
            @include border-radius(10px); }.

        </p>



        <p><b>The following CSS is produced:</b></p>



        <p><i>.box {</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>

                -webkit-border-radius:
                10px;

            </i>
        </p>

            The @extend directive has been called one
            of Sass' most powerful features. After seeing it in action, it's clear why.

        </p>



        <p>

            The idea is that with this directive you
            won't have to include multiple class names on your HTML elements and can keep
            your code DRY (don't repeat yourself). Your selectors can inherit the styles of
            other selectors, and then be easily extended when required. Now that's
            powerful.

        <p>Operators</p>



        <p>

            Having the ability to perform calculations
            in your CSS allows you to do more, like convert pixel values into percentages.
            You'll have access to standard maths functions like addition, subtraction,
            multiplication and division. Of course, these functions can be combined to
            create complex calculations.

        </p>



        <p>

            In addition, Sass includes a few built-in
            functions to help manipulate numbers. Functions like percentage(), floor() and
            round() to name a few.
